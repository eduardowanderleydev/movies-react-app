# Movie Project

This project is a simple movie app built to exercise my abilities with **React.js** and **Vite**. It was inspired by the react tutorial from Tech With Tim.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   or if using yarn:

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   or with yarn:
   ```sh

4. Open your browser and visit:
